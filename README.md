# Image-Segmentation
Project goal is to classify each pixel in an image into different categories to identify and separate distinct parts of the image. Pandas used for data manipulation and transformation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, Scikit-Learn for ML, and different algorithms are used. Each algorithm is trained and tested in separate files.
